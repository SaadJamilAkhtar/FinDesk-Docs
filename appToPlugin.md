Converting a django app to FinDesk Plugin is simple.

2. Fill config.json file with your plugin name, author name, version and other details
3. Download urls.py file from [this link](https://github.com/SaadJamilAkhtar/FinDesk-Plugin-Sample-Files)
4. create a folder `templates` in django app folder
5. create a folder with same name as your Plugin inside template folder (in this example plugin name is samplePlugin)

That's it. The Django app can now act as a FinDesk plugin
